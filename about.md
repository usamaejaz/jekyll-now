I love learning new things and playing with different technologies, projects and tools. I also have some side projects which you can find on github or on this website. 

My major expertise and interest lies in the following programming languages. 
- **PHP**
- **Javascript** (and **NodeJS**)

Other programming languages I can work with are **Python**, **Java** and some others. 

When I am not working, I enjoy reading books, playing games, doing crazy things, learning new languages and behaviors.
